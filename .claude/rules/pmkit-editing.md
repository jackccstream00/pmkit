# pmkit Editing Rules

## pmkit is READ-ONLY

Do not edit pmkit files without explicit user permission. If you think pmkit needs changes, ask first.

## When You Do Change pmkit

**THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

1. **If you change ANY code in pmkit** → Update CLAUDE.md to reflect the change
2. **If a new rule/pattern is established** → Add it to CLAUDE.md immediately
3. **If user disagrees with current implementation and we change it** → Update CLAUDE.md to match
4. **If you add a new feature** → Document it in CLAUDE.md
5. **If you deprecate/remove something** → Remove it from CLAUDE.md

## Fix Issues Directly

If anything is incorrect in pmkit → Fix it and do not come up with workarounds.

**All fixes need user approval.** Always for pmkit.

## Before Completing Any pmkit Task

Ask yourself: "Does CLAUDE.md need to be updated?"

CLAUDE.md is a **living document**. It must always accurately reflect the current state of pmkit. Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation.
